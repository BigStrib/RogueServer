            This Firefox extension is designed for the 24/7 streams, allowing users to play stream replays in the background without needing to keep a tab open.
<br><br> 
            I've also been considering the other live streams available on RogueServer. Currently, the extension plays these streams using specific MP3 URLs that are hardcoded into the extension. If you have ways to incroprate these other 
            streams into the extension feel free to let me know! As I am unsure of a way to do this.  
   <br> <br>         
            For now, we can keep it simple if you're interested in this idea.
